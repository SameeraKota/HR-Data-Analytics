# HR-Data-Analytics #Dataset from FP20 Analytics Challenge

Happy to share the outcome of my recent data analysis journey. Despite the completion of the FP20 Analytics Challenge, I couldn't resist diving deeper into the dataset available on their official website. Utilizing DAX in Power BI, I've distilled some key insights.

Key Metrics:
Attrition Rate: How many employees we're losing.
Retention Rate: How good we are at keeping our awesome team.
Turnover Rate: The overall churn in our workforce.
Last Year's Salary Average: A look back at salaries last year.
YoY Salary Change: The percentage change in salaries from year to year.

Report: 
1. Employee Insights I: Explored the organizational landscape, unveiling gender distribution, job roles, and branch-wise representation. Delving into diversity and workforce distribution offers valuable insights into the fabric of the company.
2. Employee Insights II: Navigated the financial and employee satisfaction terrain. This page provides a comprehensive view of total compensation, annual salary insights, and a breakdown of leave reasons. A holistic perspective on employee well-being and financial aspects.
3. Employee Insights III: Uncovered managerial impact and performance metrics. Charts on turnover rates, year-over-year changes, and salary comparison from 2014 to 2019 offer a strategic view of employee performance and financial trends.

Key Insights:
> Predominantly a workforce in their 60s.

> Most hires in 2014; 85.3% still active.
